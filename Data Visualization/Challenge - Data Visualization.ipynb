The goal is to better understand the underlying economics of Hollywood and explore the outlier nature of success of movies. The dataset was compiled by [David McCandless](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/) and you can read about how the data was compiled here. You'll use a version of this dataset that was compiled by [John Goodall](http://jgoodall.me/), which can be downloaded from his Github repo [here](https://github.com/jgoodall/cinevis/blob/master/data/csvs/moviedata.csv)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sh\n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgoodall/cinevis/master/data/csvs/moviedata.csv\n\nls -l"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nhollywood_movies = pd.read_csv('moviedata.csv')\nprint hollywood_movies.head()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print hollywood_movies['exclude'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["hollywood_movies = hollywood_movies.drop('exclude', axis=1)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2: Scatter Plots - Profitability And Audience Ratings\n\nLet's generate 2 scatter plots to better understand the relationship between the profitability of a movie and how an audience rated it."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 10))\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)\nax1.scatter(hollywood_movies['Profitability'], hollywood_movies['Audience Rating'])\nax1.set(xlabel='Profitability', ylabel='Audience Rating', title='Hollywood Movies, 2007-2011')\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(2, 1, 2)\nax2.scatter(hollywood_movies['Audience Rating'], hollywood_movies['Profitability'])\nax2.set(xlabel='Audience Rating', ylabel='Profitability', title='Hollywood Movies, 2007-2011')\n\ndisplay(plt.show())"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3: Scatter Matrix - Profitability And Critic Ratings\n\nBoth scatter plots in the previous step contained 1 outlier data point, which caused the scale of both plots to be incredibly lopsided to accomodate for this one outlier.
