They've since become popularized again through the recent Disney movies as part of the new Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe team at FiveThirtyEight wanted to dissect the deaths of the Avengers in the comics over the years. The writers were known to kill off and revive many of the superheroes so they were curious to know what data they could grab from the Marvel Wikia site, a fan-driven community site, to explore further. To learn how they collected their data, which is available on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/avengers/avengers.csv), read the writeup they published on their site."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sh\n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv\n\nls -l"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3: Exploring The Data\n\nWhile the FiveThirtyEight team has done a wonderful job acquiring this data, the data still has some inconsistencies.

If you plot a histogram of the values in the `Year` column, which describes the year each Avenger was introduced, you'll immediately notice some oddities. There are quite a few Avengers who look like they were introduced in 1900, which we know is a little fishy. The Avengers weren't introduced in the comic series until the 1960's!\n\nThis is obviously a mistake in the data and you should remove all Avengers before 1960 from the DataFrame."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["true_avengers = avengers[avengers['Year'] >= 1960]\n\nprint('All: ' + str(len(avengers.index)))\nprint('After 1960: ' + str(len(true_avengers.index)))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 5: Consolidating Deaths\n\nWe are interested in the number of total deaths each character experienced and we'd like a field containing that distilled information.
